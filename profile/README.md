## What is Pentulz?

Pentulz is a platform that **orchestrates pentest tools on distributed agents** and centralizes results in one interface.  

✔️ Agents run locally on target environments (on-prem, cloud)  
✔️ Backend normalizes outputs into a unified schema  
✔️ Frontend provides clear dashboards, tables, graphs & exports  

**Impact:** faster audits, fewer errors, more value from security engagements.
